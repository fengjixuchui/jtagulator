    TAP Controller
 
    The movement of data through the TAP is controlled by supplying the proper logic level to the
    TMS pin at the rising edge of consecutive TCK cycles. The TAP controller itself is a finite state
    machine that is capable of 16 states. Each state contains a link in the operation sequence necessary
    to manipulate the data moving through the TAP.

    TAP Notes:
    1. Data is valid on TDO beginning with the falling edge of TCK on entry into the
       Shift_DR or Shift_IR states. TDO goes "push-pull" on this TCK falling edge and remains "push-pull"
       until the TCK rising edge.
    2. Data is not shifted in from TDI on entry into Shift_DR or Shift_IR.    
    3. Data is shifted in from TDI on exit of Shift_IR and Shift_DR.
